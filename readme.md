# Orbus Audio Player

## Why?

Orbus Player was born on "07/13/2020", being only an audio player made in python.

I wanted to jump to a graphical interface, however I did not want to use Tkinter since it seems a bit backwards (graphically). I wanted to keep the python language since it is my favorite language

So I decided to learn ```FLET``` to be able to do this project.

> Flet allows you to use Flutter "widgets" using python as the main language.

The project starts today and we will work hard until we have a competent music player.

The work is not finished yet, it is just beginning and work is being done on the skeleton of the app, to later add the basic functionalities of a music player.
